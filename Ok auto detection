Here's a C# code snippet for a WPF application that detects an 800x600 resolution screen from multiple screens and opens a new window on that screen if available.

First, ensure you have the necessary references:

Add a reference to System.Windows.Forms to use the Screen class.
Add a reference to System.Drawing.
Use the following code to detect the screen and open a new window:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Windows;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace ScreenDetectionApp
{
    public partial class MainWindow : Window
    {
        public MainWindow()
        {
            InitializeComponent();

            // Detect the screen with 800x600 resolution
            var targetScreen = Screen.AllScreens.FirstOrDefault(s => s.Bounds.Width == 800 && s.Bounds.Height == 600);

            if (targetScreen != null)
            {
                // Create and show the new window on the detected screen
                var newWindow = new Window
                {
                    Title = "Target Resolution Screen",
                    Width = 800,
                    Height = 600
                };

                // Calculate the top-left corner position of the target screen
                var workingArea = targetScreen.WorkingArea;
                newWindow.Left = workingArea.Left;
                newWindow.Top = workingArea.Top;

                newWindow.Show();
            }
            else
            {
                MessageBox.Show("No screen with 800x600 resolution found.");
            }
        }
    }
}
This code performs the following steps:

Initializes the main window.
Searches through all available screens to find one with the resolution of 800x600.
If such a screen is found, it creates a new window and positions it at the top-left corner of the detected screen.
If no screen with the desired resolution is found, it displays a message box.
Important Points:
This code assumes you have a MainWindow.xaml defined in your WPF application.
The System.Windows.Forms.Screen class provides the functionality to detect screen properties.
The Window.Left and Window.Top properties are used to position the new window on the desired screen.
Make sure to handle edge cases as needed, such as when multiple screens have the same resolution or when there are no screens matching the desired resolution.
