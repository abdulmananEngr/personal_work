To detect the health condition of the engine using the provided UAV engine telemetry data, we can follow these steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Let's start by loading the data and performing some basic preprocessing, such as handling missing values and normalizing the data. We'll also assign short names to the columns for convenience.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Sample data provided
data = [
    [3.06, 88.235, 24.994, 16.968, 1705.2, 83.333, 81.765, 71.569, 75.608, 79.023, 103.93, 101.97, 75.49, 0.96402, 37.059, 34.706, 26.774, 26.625, 0, 0, 9.6078, 14, 21],
    # ... (other data points)
]

# Column names
columns = [
    "time", "throttle", "engine_revolution", "true_air_speed", "pressure_height", "cylinder_head_temp_1", "cylinder_head_temp_2",
    "coolant_temp", "exhaust_temp_1", "exhaust_temp_2", "exhaust_temp_3", "exhaust_temp_4", "engine_oil_temp",
    "engine_oil_pressure", "manifold_air_temp_1", "manifold_air_temp_2", "manifold_air_pressure_1", "manifold_air_pressure_2",
    "fuel_flow_main", "fuel_flow_return", "fuel_temp", "fuel_pressure", "air_fuel_ratio"
]

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=columns)

# Handling missing values (if any)
df.fillna(0, inplace=True)

# Normalizing data
normalized_df = (df - df.mean()) / df.std()

# Display the first few rows of the normalized DataFrame
print(normalized_df.head())
Data Visualization:
Visualizing the data can provide insights into its distribution and trends. We'll use libraries like matplotlib and seaborn for this purpose.
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Plot histograms of selected columns
selected_columns = ["throttle", "engine_revolution", "true_air_speed", "engine_oil_temp", "engine_oil_pressure"]
sns.set(style="whitegrid")
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
normalized_df[selected_columns].hist(bins=20, edgecolor='black', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
Data Augmentation (Optional):
If you have a limited dataset, data augmentation techniques can help in increasing the diversity of your data. However, in this case, since the data seems to be telemetry readings, data augmentation might not be directly applicable.

Machine Learning Model:
We'll use a simple anomaly detection approach to determine if the engine health is good or bad. One common method is the Isolation Forest algorithm.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Training the Isolation Forest model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05, random_state=42)
model.fit(normalized_df)

# Predicting anomalies
anomalies = model.predict(normalized_df)
df['anomaly'] = anomalies

# Visualizing anomalies
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(df['time'], df['engine_oil_pressure'], label='Engine Oil Pressure')
plt.scatter(df[df['anomaly'] == -1]['time'], df[df['anomaly'] == -1]['engine_oil_pressure'], color='red', label='Anomaly')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Engine Oil Pressure')
plt.legend()
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
Evaluation:
Evaluating anomaly detection can be challenging, especially with unlabeled data. You can inspect the flagged anomalies and compare them to actual instances of engine issues, if available, to assess the model's performance.
Remember that the provided data might not be sufficient for training a highly accurate model. More data and potentially labeled instances of engine health conditions would improve the model's effectiveness.

Please note that the above code snippets provide a general guideline. You might need to adjust parameters and methods based on your specific requirements and dataset characteristics.

also draw correlation curve of attributes
ChatGPT
Certainly! You can draw a correlation matrix heatmap to visualize the relationships between different attributes in the dataset. Here's how you can do it using the seaborn library:

python
Copy code
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix = normalized_df.corr()

# Create a heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0, linewidths=0.5)
plt.title("Correlation Matrix Heatmap")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
This code will generate a heatmap where the colors represent the strength and direction of the correlations between different attributes. Positive correlations are indicated by warmer colors, while negative correlations are shown by cooler colors. The annot=True argument adds the numerical correlation values to the heatmap cells for better interpretation.

Remember that correlation doesn't imply causation, but it can help you identify relationships and potential patterns within the data.
